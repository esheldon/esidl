<H2>OBJECT1_FLAGS</h2>
The object1_flags apply to individual bandpasses.  Your flag structure will
only refer to them by the name: object1_edge -> edge  These flags can also be
addressed to the object as a whole with the objc_flags

"type" field in the object HDU.  The legal values are:
<pre>
  OBJ_TYPE_UNK,         /* Unknown	*/
  OBJ_TYPE_CR,          /* Cosmic ray	*/
  OBJ_TYPE_DEFECT,      /* Defect	*/
